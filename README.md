Netflix style recommendation system - small scale

This project is a simple, collaborative-filtering-based recommendation 
system built using Python and pandas. Inspired by the logic behind Netflix 
and other streaming platforms, the goal was to simulate how similar users' 
preferences can help generate meaningful recommendations.

##  Project Overview

- **Type**: Collaborative Filtering
- **Goal**: Recommend movies to users based on the ratings of similar 
users
- **Tools Used**: Python, pandas, NumPy, cosine similarity
- **Dataset**: Simulated dataset of user movie ratings (small scale, for 
proof-of-concept)

##  What This Project Demonstrates

- Data cleaning and transformation with pandas
- Calculating user similarity using cosine distance
- Building and ranking movie recommendations
- Presenting results in an interpretable way
- Writing clean, well-documented code in a Jupyter Notebook

## Sample Output

The system identifies users with similar movie tastes and recommends 
top-rated movies they havenâ€™t seen yet. You can explore the notebook for 
annotated logic and outputs.

## File

- `Recommendation2.0.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, explanation, and 
outputs

##  Next Steps

- Add support for real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens)
- Incorporate matrix factorization or content-based hybrid models
- Deploy as a simple app or API
