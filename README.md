# Data Science Projects and Exercises

A collection of data science projects and practice exercises, including a Netflix-style recommendation system, SQL queries, and Python coding challenges. This repository showcases practical applications of machine learning, data analysis, and problem-solving skills.

Netflix style recommendation system - small scale

This project is a simple, collaborative-filtering-based recommendation 
system built using Python and pandas. Inspired by the logic behind Netflix 
and other streaming platforms, the goal was to simulate how similar users' 
preferences can help generate meaningful recommendations.

###  Project Overview

- **Type**: Collaborative Filtering
- **Goal**: Recommend movies to users based on the ratings of similar 
users
- **Tools Used**: Python, pandas, NumPy, cosine similarity
- **Dataset**: Simulated dataset of user movie ratings (small scale, for 
proof-of-concept)

###  What This Project Demonstrates

- Data cleaning and transformation with pandas
- Calculating user similarity using cosine distance
- Building and ranking movie recommendations
- Presenting results in an interpretable way
- Writing clean, well-documented code in a Jupyter Notebook

### Sample Output

The system identifies users with similar movie tastes and recommends 
top-rated movies they havenâ€™t seen yet. You can explore the notebook for 
annotated logic and outputs.

### File

- `Recommendation2.0.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, explanation, and 
outputs

###  Next Steps

- Add support for real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens)
- Incorporate matrix factorization or content-based hybrid models
- Deploy as a simple app or API




##  Python Exercises

- **Python_LeetCode_Exercises_#49-#56.ipynb**: Solutions to LeetCode problems #49 to #56, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
- **Python_LeetCode_Top_K_Frequent_Elements.ipynb**: Solves the "Top K Frequent Elements" problem using Python's collections and heapq modules.

##  SQL Notebooks

- **SQL_Top_3_Categories_ViewTime.ipynb**: Retrieves the top 3 video categories by total view time using SQL aggregation.
- **SQL_Highest_Daily_ViewTime_By_Category.ipynb**: Identifies the day with the highest view time for each category using window functions.
- **SQL_Average_Time_Per_Video_Ranked_By_Category.ipynb**: Calculates average view time per video and ranks them within each category.


##  Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, collections, heapq)
- SQL (SQLite syntax)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Purpose

This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science skills, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, SQL querying, and algorithmic problem-solving. It reflects my ongoing learning journey and preparation for data science roles.
